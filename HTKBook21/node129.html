Before delving into the details of word networks<A NAME=10406>&#160;</A> and dictionaries, it will
be helpful to understand their r&#244;le in building a speech recogniser
using HTK.  Fig&nbsp;<A HREF="node129.html#frecsys">11.1</A> illustrates the overall recognition
process.  A word network is defined using HTK Standard Lattice Format
(SLF).  An SLF  word network is just a text file and it can be written
directly with a text editor or a tool can be used to build it. HTK provides 
two such tools, HBUILD and
HPARSE.  These both take as input a textual description and
output an SLF file.  Other methods of generating SLF files might in the future
include 
graphics-based systems which allow the required networks to be drawn on
the screen.  Whatever method is chosen, word network SLF generation 
is done <i>off-line</i>
and is part of the system build process.
<P>
An SLF file contains a list of nodes representing words and a
list of arcs representing the transitions between words.   The transitions
can have probabilities attached to them and these can be used to indicate
<i>preferences</i> in a grammar network.  They can also be used to
represent bigram probabilities in a back-off bigram network and 
HBUILD can generate such a bigram network automatically.
In addition to an SLF file, a HTK recogniser requires a 
dictionary to supply pronunciations for each word in the network
and a set of acoustic HMM phone models. 
Dictionaries are input via the HTK interface module HDICT.
<P>
The dictionary, HMM set and word network are input to the HTK library
module HNET whose function is to generate an equivalent network of
HMMs. Each word in the dictionary may have several pronunciations and in
this case there will be one branch in the network corresponding to each
alternative pronunciation. Each pronunciation may consist either of a list
of phones or a list of HMM names. In the former case, HNET can
optionally expand the HMM network to use either word internal triphones or
cross-word triphones.
Once the HMM network has been constructed, it can be
input to the decoder module HREC and used to recognise
speech input.  Note that HMM network construction is performed <i>on-line</i>
at recognition time as part of the initialisation process.

<P>
For convenience, HTK provides a recognition<A NAME=10422>&#160;</A> tool called HVITE
to allow the functions provided by HNET and HREC
to be invoked from the command line. HVITE is particularly
useful for running experimental evaluations on test speech stored
in disk files and for basic testing using live audio input.
However, application developers
should note that HVITE is just a shell containing calls to
load the word network, dictionary and models; generate the recognition
network and then repeatedly recognise each input utterance.
For embedded applications, it may well be appropriate to
dispense with HVITE and call the functions in 
HNET and HREC directly from the application.
The use of HVITE is explained in the next chapter.
