When building sub-word based continuous density systems, 
the final system will typically consist of multiple mixture component
context-dependent HMMs.  However, as indicated previously, the early
stages of triphone construction, particularly state tying, are best done
with single Gaussian models.  Indeed, if tree-based clustering is to be
used there is no option.<A NAME=9868>&#160;</A><A NAME=9869>&#160;</A>
<P>
In HTK therefore, the conversion from single Gaussian HMMs to multiple
mixture component HMMs is usually one of the final steps in building
a system.  The mechanism provided to do this is the HHED <tt>MU</tt> command
which will increase the number of components in a mixture by 
a process called <i>mixture splitting</i>.
This approach to building a multiple
mixture component system is extremely
flexible since it allows the number of mixture components to be repeatedly increased
until the desired level of performance is achieved.<A NAME=9873>&#160;</A>
<P>
The <tt>MU</tt> command<A NAME=9939>&#160;</A> has the form
<PRE>     MU n itemList</PRE>
where <tt>n</tt> gives the new number of mixture components required and
<tt>itemList</tt> defines the actual mixture distributions to modify.  This
command works by repeatedly splitting the mixture with the largest mixture
weight until the required number of components is obtained.  The actual
split is performed by copying the mixture, dividing the weights of both
copies by 2, and finally perturbing the means by plus or minus 0.2 standard
deviations.
For example, the command
<PRE>     MU 3 {aa.state[2].mix}</PRE>
would increase the number of mixture components in the output distribution
for state 2 of model <tt>aa</tt> to 3.   Normally, however,  the number of
components in all mixture distributions will be increased at the same time.
Hence, a command of the form is more usual
<PRE>     MU 3 {*.state[2-4].mix}</PRE>
It is usually a good idea to increment mixture components in
stages, for example, by incrementing by 1 or 2 then re-estimating, then
incrementing by 1 or 2 again and re-estimating, and so on until the
required number of components are obtained.  This also allows recognition performance
to be monitored to find the optimum.
<P>
One final point with regard to multiple mixture component distributions is that
all HTK tools ignore mixture components whose weights fall below a threshold value
called <tt>MINMIX</tt> (defined in <tt>HModel.h</tt>).  Such mixture components
are called <I>defunct</I>.  Defunct mixture components can be
prevented by setting the <tt>-w</tt> option in HEREST so that all mixture
weights are floored to some level above 
<tt>MINMIX</tt><A NAME=9940>&#160;</A>.  If 
mixture weights<A NAME=9886>&#160;</A>
are allowed to fall below <tt>MINMIX</tt> then the corresponding Gaussian
parameters will not be written out when the model containing that component
is saved.  It is possible to recover from this, however, since the <tt>MU</tt> command
will replace defunct mixtures<A NAME=9889>&#160;</A> before performing any requested mixture
component increment.
