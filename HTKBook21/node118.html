As explained in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node93.html#cHMMDefs">7</A>, HTK uses macros to support a 
generalised parameter tying facility.  Referring again to
Fig.&nbsp;7.<A HREF="node96.html#fhierarch">7.8</A>, each of the solid black circles denotes a potential
<EM>tie-point</EM> in the hierarchy of HMM parameters.  When two or more
parameter sets are tied, the same set of parameter values are shared by all
the <EM>owners</EM> of the tied set.  Externally, tied parameters<A NAME=9702>&#160;</A> are
represented by macros and internally they are represented by structure 
sharing.  The accumulators needed for  the numerators and denominators of
the Baum-Welch re-estimation formulae  given in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node110.html#sbwformulae">8.7</A>
are attached directly to  the parameters themselves. Hence,  when the values
of a tied parameter set are re-estimated, all of the data which would have
been used to  estimate each individual untied parameter are effectively
pooled leading to more robust parameter estimation.<A NAME=9704>&#160;</A>
<P>
Note also that although parameter tying is implemented in
a way which makes it transparent to the HTK re-estimation and recognition
tools.  In practice, these tools do notice when a system has been tied
and try to take advantage of it by avoiding redundant computations.
<P>
Although macro definitions could be written by hand, in practice,
tying is performed by executing HHED commands and the
resulting
macros are thus generated automatically.  The basic HHED command for
tying a set of parameters is the <tt>TI</tt> command which has the form
<PRE>   TI macroname itemlist</PRE>
This causes all items in the given <tt>itemlist</tt> to be tied together
and output as a macro called <tt>macroname</tt>.  Macro names are
written as a string of
characters optionally enclosed in double quotes.  The latter are necessary
if the name contains one or more characters which are not letters or digits.

<P>
Item lists use a simple language to identify sets of points in the 
HMM parameter hierarchy illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;7.<A HREF="node96.html#fhierarch">7.8</A>.  
This language is defined fully in the reference entry
for HHED.
The essential idea is that item lists<A NAME=10025>&#160;</A>  represent paths down the hierarchical
parameter tree where the direction <I>down</I> should be regarded as 
travelling from the <I>root</I>
of the tree to towards the <I>leaves</I>.  
A path can be unique, or more usually, it can
be a pattern representing a set of paths down the tree.  The point at
which each path stops identifies one member of the set represented by
the item list.  
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node118.html#fitemtree">9.1</A> shows the possible paths down the tree.  In
text form the branches are replaced by dots and the underlined node
names are possible terminating points.  At the topmost level, an
item list is a comma separated list of paths enclosed in braces.
<P>

<P>
Some examples, should make all this clearer.  Firstly, the
following is a legal but somewhat long-winded way of specifying
the set of items comprising states 2, 3 and 4 of the HMM called <tt>aa</tt>
<PRE>     { aa.state[2],aa.state[3],aa.state[4] }</PRE>
however in practice this would be written much more compactly as
<PRE>     { aa.state[2-4] }</PRE>
It must be emphasised that indices in item lists are really <I>patterns</I>.
The set represented by an item list consists of all those elements which
match the patterns.  Thus, if <tt>aa</tt> only had two emitting states, the above item
list would not generate an error.  It would simply only match two items.
The reason for this is that the same pattern can be applied to many different
objects.  For example, the HMM name can be replaced by a list of names 
enclosed in brackets, furthermore each HMM name can include `?' characters
which match any single character and `*' characters which match zero or
more characters.  Thus <A NAME=9724>&#160;</A>
<PRE>     { (aa+*,iy+*,eh+*).state[2-4] }</PRE>
represents states 2, 3 and 4  
of all biphone models corresponding to
the phonemes <tt>aa</tt>, <tt>iy</tt> and <tt>eh</tt>.  If <tt>aa</tt> had just 2 emitting
states and the others had 4 emitting states, then this item list would include
2 states from each of the <tt>aa</tt> models and 3 states from
each of the others.  Moving further down the tree, the item list
<PRE>     { *.state[2-4].stream[1].mix[1,3].cov }</PRE>
denotes the set of all covariance vectors (or matrices) of the first and
third mixture
components of stream 1, of states 2 to 4 of all HMMs.  Since many HMM systems
are single stream, the <tt>stream</tt> part of the path can be omitted if its value
is 1.  Thus, the above could have been written
<PRE>     { *.state[2-4].mix[1,3].cov }</PRE>
These last two examples also show that indices<A NAME=9731>&#160;</A> can be written as comma
separated lists as well as ranges, for example, <tt>[1,3,4-6,9]</tt>
is a valid index list representing states 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
<P>
When item lists are used as the argument to a <tt>TI</tt> 
command<A NAME=9926>&#160;</A>, the
kind of items represented by the list determines the macro type in a fairly
obvious way.  The only non-obvious cases are firstly that lists ending
in <tt>cov</tt> generate  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21966" SRC="img433.gif"  > <i>v</i>,  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21968" SRC="img433.gif"  > <i>i</i>,  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21970" SRC="img433.gif"  > <i>c</i>, or  <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21972" SRC="img433.gif"  > <i>x</i> macros as
appropriate.   If an explicit set of mixture components is defined
as in
<PRE>     { *.state[2].mix[1-5] }</PRE>
then   <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline21974" SRC="img433.gif"  > <i>m</i> macros are generated but omitting
the indices  altogether denotes a special case of mixture 
tying<A NAME=9741>&#160;</A>
which is explained later in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node123.html#cdiscmods">10</A>.
<P>
To illustrate the use of item lists, some example <tt>TI</tt> commands
can now be given.  Firstly, when a set of context-dependent models is created, it can
be beneficial to share one transition matrix across all variants
of a phone rather than having a distinct transition matrix for each.
This could be achieved by adding <tt>TI</tt>
commands immediately after the <tt>CL</tt> command described in
the previous section, that is<A NAME=9746>&#160;</A>
<PRE>    CL cdlist
    TI T_ah {*-ah+*.transP}
    TI T_eh {*-eh+*.transP}
    TI T_ae {*-ae+*.transP}
    TI T_ih {*-ih+*.transP}
     ... etc</PRE>
<P>
As a second example, a so-called Grand Variance<A NAME=9747>&#160;</A> 
HMM system can
be generated very easily with the following HHEd command
<PRE>     TI &quot;gvar&quot; { *.state[2-4].mix[1].cov }</PRE>
where it is assumed that the HMMs are 3-state 
single mixture component models.   The effect
of this command is to tie all state distributions to a single global variance
vector.  For applications, where there is limited training data, this technique
can improve performance, particularly in noise.
<P>
Speech recognition systems will often have distinct
models for silence  and short pauses.  A 
silence model<A NAME=9748>&#160;</A> <tt>sil</tt> may have
the normal 3 state topology whereas a short pause model may have just 
a single state.  To avoid the two models <i>competing</i> with each other, the
<tt>sp</tt> model state can be tied to the centre state of the <tt>sil</tt> model
thus
<PRE>     TI &quot;silst&quot; { sp.state[2], sil.state[3] }</PRE>
<P>
So far nothing has been said about how the parameters are actually
determined when a set of items is replaced by a single shared representative.
When states are tied, the state with the broadest  variances  and as few as
possible zero mixture component weights is selected from the pool and used
as the representative.  When mean vectors are tied, the average of all the
mean vectors in the pool is used and when variances are tied, the largest
variance in the the pool is used.  In all other cases, the last item in the
tie-list is  arbitrarily chosen as representative.
All of these selection criteria are <i>ad hoc</i>, but since
the tie operations are always followed by explicit re-estimation
using HEREST, the precise choice of representative for a tied
set is not critical.<A NAME=9755>&#160;</A>
<P>
Finally, tied parameters can be
untied.  For example,  subsequent refinements of the context-dependent model set
generated above with tied transition matrices might result in
a much more compact set of models for which individual transition
parameters could be robustly estimated.    This 
can be done using the <tt>UT</tt> command<A NAME=9927>&#160;</A> whose effect is to untie all of the
items in its argument list.  For example, the command
<PRE>     UT {*-iy+*.transP}</PRE>
would untie the transition parameters in all variants of the <tt>iy</tt>
phoneme.
This untying works by simply making unique copies of the tied parameters.
These untied parameters can then subsequently be re-estimated.
