Many HTK tools, particularly recognition tools, can input speech waveform
data directly from an audio device.  The basic mechanism for doing this is to
simply specify the source format as being
<tt>HAUDIO</tt><A NAME=4573>&#160;</A> following which speech samples
will be read directly from the host computer's audio input device.
<P>
When using direct audio input<A NAME=4032>&#160;</A>, the input sampling
rate may be set explicitly using the configuration parameter
<tt>SOURCERATE</tt>, <A NAME=4574>&#160;</A> otherwise 
HTK will assume that it has been set by some external means such as an
audio control panel.  In the latter case, it must be possible for
HAUDIO to obtain the sample rate from the audio driver
otherwise an error message will be generated.
<P>
Although the detailed control of audio hardware is typically machine dependent,
HTK provides a number of Boolean configuration variables to request specific
input and output sources.  These are indicated by the following table

The major complication in using direct audio is in starting and stopping the
input device.  The simplest approach to this is for HTK tools to take direct
control and, for example, enable the audio input for a fixed period determined
via a command line option.  However, the HAUDIO/HPARM modules
provides two more powerful built-in facilities for audio input control.
<P>
<A NAME=4055>&#160;</A> 
The first method of audio input control involves the use of an automatic
energy-based speech/silence detector which is enabled by setting the
configuration parameter
<tt>USESILDET</tt><A NAME=4580>&#160;</A> to true. Note that
the speech/silence detector can also operate on waveform input files.
<P>
The automatic speech/silence detector uses a two level algorithm which first
classifies each frame of data as either speech or silence and then applies a
heuristic to determine the start and end of each utterance.
<A NAME=4058>&#160;</A> <A NAME=4059>&#160;</A> The detector classifies each
frame as speech or silence based solely on the log energy of the signal. When
the energy value exceeds a threshold the frame is marked as speech otherwise as
silence. The threshold is made up of two components both of which can be set by
configuration variables. The first component represents the mean energy level
of silence and can be set explicitly via the configuration
parameter <tt>SILENERGY</tt>. However, it is more usual to take a measurement
from the environment directly. Setting the configuration parameter
<tt>MEASURESIL</tt> to true will cause the detector to calibrate its parameters
from the current acoustic environment just prior to sampling. The second
threshold component is the level above which frames are classified as speech 
(<tt>SPEECHTHRESH</tt>) .
<A NAME=4063>&#160;</A> <A NAME=4064>&#160;</A> <A NAME=4065>&#160;</A>
Once each frame has been classified as speech or silence they are grouped into
windows consisting of <tt>SPCSEQCOUNT</tt> consecutive frames.  When the number
of frames marked as silence within each window falls below a glitch count the
whole window is classed as speech.  Two separate glitch counts are used, <TT>
SPCGLCHCOUNT</TT> before speech onset is detected and <TT>SILGLCHCOUNT</TT> whilst
searching for the end of the utterance.  This allows the algorithm to take
account of the tendancy for the end of an utterance to be somewhat quieter than
the beginning.
<A NAME=4069>&#160;</A> <A NAME=4070>&#160;</A> 
Finally, a top level heuristic is used to determine the start and end of the
utterance. The heuristic defines the start of speech as the beginning of the
first window classified as speech.  The actual start of the processed utterance
is <tt>SILMARGIN</tt> frames before the detected start of speech to ensure that
when the speech detector triggers slightly late the recognition accuracy is not
affected.  Once the start of the utterance has been found the detector searches
for <tt>SILSEQCOUNT</tt> windows all classified as silence and sets the end of
speech to be the end of the last window classified as speech.  Once again the
processed utterance is extended <tt>SILMARGIN</tt> frames to ensure that if the
silence detector has triggered slightly early the whole of the speech is still
available for further processing.

<P>
Fig&nbsp;<A HREF="node72.html#fendpointer">5.5</A> shows an example of the speech/silence detection
process. The waveform data is first classified as speech or silence at frame
and then at window level before finally the start and end of the utterance are
marked. In the example, audio input starts at point <TT>A</TT> and is stopped
automatically at point <TT>H</TT>. The start of speech, <TT>C</TT>, occurs when a
window of <tt>SPCSEQCOUNT</tt> frames are classified as speech and the start of
the utterance occurs <tt>SILMARGIN</tt> frames earlier at <TT>B</TT>. The period
of silence from <TT>D</TT> to <TT>E</TT> is not marked as the end of the utterance
because it is shorter than <tt>SILSEQCOUNT</tt>. However after point <TT>F</TT>
no more windows are classified as speech (although a few frames are) and so
this is marked as the end of speech with the end of the utterance extended to
<TT>G</TT>.
<P>
<A NAME=4089>&#160;</A>
The second built-in mechanism for controlling audio input is by arranging for 
a signal to be sent from some other process. Sending the signal for the first
time starts the audio device. If the speech detector is not enabled then
sampling starts immediately and is stopped by sending the signal a second
time. If automatic speech/silence detection is enabled, then the first signal 
starts the detector. Sampling stops immediately when a second signal is
received or when silenece is detected. The signal number is set using the 
configuration parameter <tt>AUDIOSIG</tt><A NAME=4581>&#160;</A>. 
Keypress control operates in a similar fashion and is enabled by setting the 
configuration parameter <tt>AUDIOSIG</tt> to a negative number. In this mode
an initial keypress will be required  to start sampling/speech detection and
a second keypress will stop sampling immediately.
<P>
Audio output<A NAME=4093>&#160;</A> is also supported by HTK. There are no
generic facilities for output and the precise behaviour will depend on the tool
used. It should be noted, however, that the audio input facilities provided by
HAUDIO include provision for attaching a <i>replay buffer</i> to an
audio input channel.  This is typically used to store the last few seconds of
each input to a recognition tool in a circular buffer so that the last
utterance input can be replayed on demand.
